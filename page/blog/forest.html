					<p>What is it that I truly want?</p>

					<p>
						I got everything I wanted when I was young. I never set high expectations for myself, scared to
						end up not reaching them.
					</p>

					<p>But I underestimated how much I could do before I even reach 20. There is much to be done.</p>

					<p>And when I didn't know it, I entered a forest. Everyone else around me has, too.</p>

					<p>It's foggy. It's cold. Some of us aren't going to make it. Some close to me haven't.</p>

					<p>
						I have no mission, yet I must keep going. It's the way of the modern world. People find
						distractions, not purpose.
					</p>

					<p>
						I must find one once again. It's the mission I set for myself, to honor my mother and her
						passing.
					</p>

					<p>
						I was born as an artist. But I spent a long time becoming one so sparse and focused on so many
						different things I've never created something truly great.
					</p>

					<p>In a long time, I haven't created anything.</p>

					<p>Time is ticking. It's only going faster. Life must not be wasted. It's too great a gift.</p>

					<p>What is it that I truly want?</p>
